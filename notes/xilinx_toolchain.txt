Chapter Two of "FPGAs!? Now What?" gives a good overview of the full
compilation process:

Synthesis:
  the "logic synthesizer" compiles from HDL to a netlist

Implementation:
  the "translator" takes a set of netlists and design constraints and generates
      a merged netlist (?).
  then a "mapper" regroups the netlist so that place and route will be easier
  then a "place and route" tool decides exactly how the FPGA logic will be
      configured

Bitstream:
  the "bitstream generator" translates the configuration into the binary format
      that the FPGA uses to re-flash itself
